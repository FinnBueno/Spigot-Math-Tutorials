Hi! Here you will find the updated versions of the Spigot math tutorials written by [finnbon](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/finnbon.37739/) (me). I originally wrote these tutorials in 2015 when I was 15 year olds, and thus they leave a lot to be desired. I've rewritten all of the tutorials, with hopes of fixing most of the issues the old ones suffered from.

If you have questions, it's probably best to make a thread on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/forums/spigot-plugin-development.52/). If you have a question about the website itself, you can start a [discussion](https://github.com/FinnBueno/Spigot-Math-Tutorials/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/FinnBueno/Spigot-Math-Tutorials/issues) on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FinnBueno/Spigot-Math-Tutorials/).
