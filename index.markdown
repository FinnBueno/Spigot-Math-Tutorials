Hi! Here you will find the updated versions of the Spigot math tutorials written by [finnbon](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/finnbon.37739/) (me). I originally wrote these tutorials in 2015 when I was 15 year olds, and thus they leave a lot to be desired. I've rewritten all of the tutorials, with hopes of fixing most of the issues the old ones suffered from.

The tutorials are written to be followed one after another, though they should still function fine when ∆íollowed individually. When following the tutorials, you will sometimes come across a definition block, which looks like this:

> <span style="color: gray"><span style="font-style: normal">üí°</span> Hi, I'm a definition block! I'm used to define certain terms for further use in a tutorial. I'm mostly used for terms that aren't technical but still need to be clarified.</span>

Alternatively, you might also come across a write-along block, which looks like this:

> <span style="color: gray"><span style="font-style: normal; margin-right: 4px">üìù</span> Hi, I'm a write-along block! When you see me, it's recommended to grab a piece of paper and a pencil, and write along with whatever the tutorial is explaining. This way, you'll get a much better understanding of what's going on. I will then explain what you're supposed to do to follow along.</span>

If you have questions, it's probably best to make a thread on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/forums/spigot-plugin-development.52/). If you have a question about the website itself, you can start a [discussion](https://github.com/FinnBueno/Spigot-Math-Tutorials/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/FinnBueno/Spigot-Math-Tutorials/issues) on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FinnBueno/Spigot-Math-Tutorials/).
