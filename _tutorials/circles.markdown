In the [previous tutorial](radians), you learned about radians and what they are. Now, we're going to move onto drawing circles using radians. Before we can get started with this, it's essential to understand something about 'drawing' in Minecraft.

> <span style="color: gray"><span style="font-style: normal">ðŸ’¡</span> When referring to 'drawing' in Minecraft, what people generally mean is generating a shape using [particle effects](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Particles). However, since particles are not lines but small effects, the shape is composed of several points that are placed close together, creating the illusion of an actual line. The closer the particles are placed together, the better the illusion works, but the laggier it becomes.</span>

Now that we've defined what drawing is, we can understand the objective in front of us. We must get a list of points at which we will spawn particles, so that these particles together form a circle, like you see to the right.

If you've been programming for a while, these terms might alert you to a few things. For example, we need to <span style="font-style: italic">generate a list</span>, thus we're gonna need a loop. If you're not familiar with how to make a for-loop in Java, I recommend you do some more learning regarding those topics before continuing this tutorial.
